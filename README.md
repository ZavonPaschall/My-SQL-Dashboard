# My SQL Projects Dashboard

Below is a collection of SQL projects I've compiled and uploaded to GitHub. Please feel free to have a look!

* **Custom Jupiter Exchange KPI Tracker:** A custom dashboard for users to input a wallet address and receive aggregations, counts, and more of their total volume, transaction history, and more! [Project GitHub Link](https://github.com/ZavonPaschall/Custom-JUP-Exchange-KPI-Tracker)

* **Custom NFT Exchange KPI Tracker:** A custom dashboard for users to input a wallet address and receive history, aggregations, counts, and more of their total volume, transaction history, and more across many of the popular NFT exchanges in the Solana ecosystem!

* **KPI Activity Tracker & Auto Tweet Integration:** A static dashboard that tracks daily progress of all $BERN burnt/rewards and $BONK rewarded by the specific address: 7MyTjmRygJoCuDBUtAuSugiYZFULD2SWaoUTmtjtRDzD. After calculating the numbers, it passes the JSON Webhook to Google Sheets, then the Google Apps Script receives and places the info within the sheet. If there is new information, our Twitter integration with Sheets will make a tweet if all parameters are met.
